## 📖 Understanding Comparison and Logic
Simply put we are just comparing data to each other. If its equal greater than and etc then we execute a command. In python we do this with `if` and `else` statements. 

> tl;dr : if a condtion is true _do something_ else _say something_
### Comparisions
Here are all the comparison and logic operators:

| Operator | English             | Example              | Result |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|
| >        | Greater Than        | 4 > 3                | True   |
| <        | Less Than           | 4 < 3                | False  |
| >=       | Greater or Equal to | 10 >= 10             | True   |
| <=       | Less or Equal to    | 9 <= 10              | True   |
| ==       | Equal to            | 9 == 10              | False  |
| and      | n/a                 | `True and False`     | False  |
| or       | n/a                 | `False or True`      | True   |
| not      | n/a                 | `True and not False` | True   |
