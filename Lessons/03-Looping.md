## 📖 Understanding Python Math and Looping
### Math
python basic operators and sytax as follows:
#### Basic Arithmatic
```python
print((1 * 2 + 3)/5) # 1 multiplied by 2 plus 2 all divided by 5
```
#### Exponets
```python
print(2**5) # 2^5: 2 to the 5th power
```
#### Modulus
```python
print(20 % 3) # Returns the remainder
```
And just like in `Day 2: Variables & Data Types` some math operators can be applied to Data Types:
```python
# Strings
hello_10 = "hello" * 10
helloworld = "hello" + "" + "world"

# list 
list_list = [1,2,3] + [4,5,6]
list_10 = [1,2,4] * 10
```
> _Always play around with the code!_
### Looping
Looping is exactly what it sounds like! The act of repeating, in programing we are talking about repeating the same bit of code ounce a condition is completed _otherwise it will repeat forever_.

Python uses two key words `while` and `for` to create a loop.

Here are the basic conditions: 

| Operator | English             | Example              | Result |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|
| >        | Greater Than        | 4 > 3                | True   |
| <        | Less Than           | 4 < 3                | False  |
| >=       | Greater or Equal to | 10 >= 10             | True   |
| <=       | Less or Equal to    | 9 <= 10              | True   |
| ==       | Equal to            | 9 == 10              | False  |
